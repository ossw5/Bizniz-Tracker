## 🔍 Example Workflow

### Scenario: Running a Pop-up Shop

**Step 1: Add Inventory**
- Go to Inventory screen
- Add "T-Shirt" (qty: 50, cost: $5, sell: $15, min stock: 5)
- Add "Hoodie" (qty: 30, cost: $12, sell: $28, min stock: 3)

**Step 2: First Sales**
- Go to Home screen, tap FAB or navigate to "Add Sale"
- Sell 3 T-Shirts at $15 each → Total: $45
- Inventory updates: T-Shirt qty now 47
- Home dashboard shows: Revenue $45, Profit $30 (3 × ($15-$5)), Sales 1

**Step 3: Multiple Sales**
- Sell 2 Hoodies at $28 each → Total: $56
- Home dashboard now shows: Revenue $101, Profit $56, Sales 2

**Step 4: Low Stock Check**
- Sell 45 more T-Shirts (impossible if only 47 left - validation prevents this)
- Sell 25 T-Shirts → qty becomes 22 (still above min stock of 5, no alert)
- Sell 18 more T-Shirts → qty becomes 4 (below min stock of 5)
- Home screen shows low stock alert for T-Shirt

**Step 5: Analytics**
- Go to Sales Summary
- View daily totals: All sales for today aggregated
- See revenue vs cost breakdown
- Understand profitability

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No products available" Error
- **Cause**: You haven't added any products yet
- **Fix**: Go to Inventory screen, tap the FAB (+) button to add your first product

### Sale quantity rejected / "Cannot sell more than available"
- **Cause**: Entered quantity exceeds stock
- **Fix**: Reduce quantity to match available stock shown in helper text

### Home dashboard shows old data
- **Cause**: Cache not refreshed
- **Fix**: 
  - Pull down to refresh (if implemented) or
  - Navigate away and back to Home screen

### App won't start
- **Cause**: Build issues or missing dependencies
- **Fix**: 
  ```bash
  flutter pub get
  flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
  flutter run
  ```

### Data not persisting
- **Cause**: Hive boxes not opened properly
- **Fix**: Restart app. Data should be in Hive IndexedDB (browser) or documents (mobile).
